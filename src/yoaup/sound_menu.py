"""Contains SoundMenuControls, A class to make it easy to integrate with the
Ubuntu Sound Menu.

In order for a media player to appear in the sonud menu, it must have
a desktop file in /usr/share/applications. For example, for a media player
named "simple" player, there must be desktop file /usr/share/applications/
simple-player.desktop

The desktop file must specify that it is indeed a media player. For example,
simple-player.desktop might look like the follwing:
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Simple Player
Comment=SimplePlayer application
Categories=GNOME;Audio;Music;Player;AudioVideo;
Exec=simple-player
Icon=simple-player
Terminal=false
Type=Application
MimeType=application/x-ogg;application/ogg;audio/x-vorbis+ogg;audio/x-scpls;
audio/x-mp3;audio/x-mpeg;audio/mpeg;audio/x-mpegurl;audio/x-flac;

In order for the sound menu to run, a dbus loop must be running before
the player is created and before the gtk. mainloop is run. you can add
DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True) to your application's __main__ function.

The Ubuntu Sound Menu integrates with applications via the MPRIS2 dbus api,
which is specified here: http://www.mpris.org/2.1/spec/

This module does strive to provide an MPRIS2 implementation, but rather
focuses on the subset of functionality required by the Sound Menu.

The SoundMenuControls class can be ininstatiated, but does not provide any
default functionality. In order to provide the required functionality,
implementations must be provided for the functions starting with
"_sound_menu", such as "_sound_menu_play", etc...

Functions and properties starting with capitalize letters, such as
"Next" and "Previous" are called by the Ubuntu Sound Menu. These
functions and properties are not designed to be called directly
or overriden by application code, only the Sound Menu.

Other functions are designed to be called as needed by the
implementation to inform the Sound Menu of changes. Thse functions
include signal_playing, signal_paused, and song_changed.

Using
#create the sound menu object and reassign functions
sound_menu = SoundMenuControls(desktop_name)
sound_menu._sound_menu_next = _sound_menu_next
sound_menu._sound_menu_previous = _sound_menu_previous
sound_menu._sound_menu_is_playing = _sound_menu_is_playing
sound_menu._sound_menu_play = _sound_menu_play
sound_menu._sound_menu_pause = _sound_menu_play
sound_menu._sound_menu_raise = _sound_menu_raise

#when the song in the player changes, it should inform
the sond menu
sound_menu.song_changed(artist,album,title)

#when the player changes to/from the playing, it should inform the sound menu
sound_menu.signal_playing()
sound_menu.signal_paused()

#whent the song is changed from the application,
#use song_changed to inform the Ubuntu Sound Menu
sound_menu.song_changed(artist, album, song_title)

Configuring
SoundMenuControls does not come with any stock behaviors, so it
cannot be configured

Extending
SoundMenuControls can be used as a base class with single or multiple
inheritance.
